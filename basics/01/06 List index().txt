Parameters:  

element – The element whose lowest index will be returned.
start (Optional) – The position from where the search begins.
end (Optional) – The position from where the search ends.
Returns: 





		Find the index of the element

>>> Arunodaya_1 = ['Adam', 'Sajad', 'Avinash', 'Arshad', 'Varun', 'Sudheesh', 'Sreekuttan']
  
# Will print the index of 'Adam' in list1
>>> Arunodaya_1.index('Adam')
0
  
# Will print the index of 'Sreekuttan' in list2 
>>> Arunodaya_1.index('Sreekuttan')
6

>>> sample = ['mark', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'mark', 'mar']
  

# Will print index of 'mark' in sublist

>>> print(sample.index('mark', 2, 6))
5
  
# Will print index of 'mark' in sublist
# having index from 0 to 6
>>> print(sample.index('mark', 0, 6))
